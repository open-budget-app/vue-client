# Open Budget App

Found at [www.openbudget.app](https://openbudget.app), Open Budget App is an open source personal zero-sum based budgetting application. This is the codebase for the frontend of Open Budget App. It is written in Vue and it can compile to a web app and a Electron app. In the future we'd like to add Android/iOS support too.
